# Predation (in broad ecological terms)

.font150[
Any interaction between two species in which one is benefited and the other is harmed.

Density of one species changes the .blue[***per capita***] population growth rate of the other

Species A (_resource_) --- **.green[+]** ---> Species B (_consumer_)

Species A (_resource_) <--- **.red[-]** --- Species B (_consumer_)
] 

???

It is per captia, not necessary the population size. For example, if it is a good year with mild winter, then rabbits survival will be high, leading to a high population growth rate and the abundance of rabbits will be high by the end of summer. Foxes will take advantage of this and kill more rabbits than normal. Even though the population size of rabbits increased, the per capita population growth rate will be lower than those without foxes.

# Types of predation

.font150[
A. Predator-prey (e.g., lions and wildebeests)

B. Herbivore-plant (e.g., rabbits and dandelions)

C. Parasite-host (e.g., filariasis and humans)

???

Predators faced with the choice between killing prey and starving, or having their offspring starve, should always kill the prey.
