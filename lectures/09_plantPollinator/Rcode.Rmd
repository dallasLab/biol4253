## Ecological networks


Unipartite

```{r}




```


Bipartite

```{r}




```







## Network characteristics

degree, connectance, etc.

Root these to disease spread or something like that:

unipartite (remove nodes with high degree, examine how a pathogen spreads in a modular versus nested network)

bipartite (show distribution of degree for host-parasite or plant-pollinatr networks, show common nestedness or modularity values for bipartite networks)


```{r}

## Network structure
