## What is ecology? 

### The study of interactions between biological organisms and their environment.

---

## Interactions with same species

+ .font200[Competition]
  + food
  + space
  + mates
+ .font200[Cannibalism]
+ .font200[Dispersal processes]

---

## Interactions with different species

+ .font200[Competition]
+ .font200[Predator -- prey]
+ .font200[Plant -- pollinator]
+ .font200[Host -- parasite]




---

## Interactions with the environment

+ .font200[Allelopathy]
+ .font200[Thermal tolerance]
+ .font200[Disturbance ecology]
+ .font200[Dispersal limitation]
+ .font200[Ecosystem engineers]

# Environmentalism

### A political and social ideology seeking to limit human impact on the environment


---

# Biomedicine

###  Gets conflated with ideas of "mainstream medicine"
### Generally applies to clinical practice and only to human populations (can some part of the environment make me better?)
 


---

# Natural history

### Descriptive study of natural organisms 

### Slightly separate from ecology, though ecological studies often utilize museum collections, and museum collections are essentially natural history storehouses







---

# Evolution


### Change of allele frequencies over time

### Strong feedbacks with ecological processes

>  "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense except in the Light of Evolution"
- Theodosius Dobzhansky

# levels of biological organization

---

# Individual 

### A single individual of a species.  

### e.g., a single trout in lake superior









---

# Population

### A collection of individuals that occupy a given geographic area and interact with one another.

### e.g., trout in lake superior




---

# Community 

### A set of interacting species that occupy a given geographic area.

### e.g., fish communities in lake superior



---

# Ecosystem

### The set of interacting species (the community) and the interactions between these species and their physical environment. 






---

# Biosphere

### The global environment, consisting of all living things on the planet.

### e.g., the planet




---

# What is the role of the environment and land use change to each level?
