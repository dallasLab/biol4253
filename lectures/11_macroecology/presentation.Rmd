# What is .green[Macro]ecology?

???

the prefix "macro" for two reasons. 1) in order to characterize patterns in the statistical distributions of variables among individuals, populations, or species, it is usually necessary to work at relatively large spatial and/or temporal scales so as to obtain sufficiently large samples. 2) in order to investigate the implications of important advances in other disciplines such as biogeography, paleo-biology, systematics, and the earth sciences, it is necessary to expand the scale of ecological research.

Macroecology differs from most of recent and current ecology in its emphasis on statistical pattern analysis rather than experimental manipulation

In the reductionist view, adequate modelling of the components should always reproduce all emergent phenomena.

the claim that macroecology can be explained by individuals and population dynamics can be demonstrated rigorously to be possible only rarely, owing to the transmutation problem

# Hypotheses

.font150[

Speciation and extinction rates determine species richness

- Climate: high solar energy, low seasonality --> high productivity --> high species richness (recall foodweb)

- Historical:  more time, less perturbed in the past by climatic events, accumulating species over time

- Geographic: larger and more heterogeneous areas in tropics

- Mid-domain effect: bounded geographical domain + random shifting species ranges --> mid-domain peak of species richness. Null models

.font200[.red[Not mutually exclusive]]

.font200[Elevational gradient]

???

If species' ranges are randomly shuffled within a bounded geographical domain free of environmental gradients, ranges overlap increasingly toward the center of the domain, creating a “mid‐domain” peak of species richness.

???

Phylogeny I : Random ancestral colonization by a large-bodied species
Phylogeny II: Selective advantage of traits which are accidentally coupled with large body size
Dispersal ability: Small body mass is associated with low dispersal ability 
Heat conservation: Increased heat conservation of large-bodied species; the higher surface area to volume ratio of smaller individuals results in improved heat dissipation in hot environments 
Starvation resistance: Increased starvation resistance of large-bodied species
