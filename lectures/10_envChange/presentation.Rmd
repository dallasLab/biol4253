# Global Environmental Change

.font200[What are the problems?]  
.font200[What can we do about them?]




???

Throughout this course, we have touched on many environmental change problems, from land use change to pest control to species diversity loss. This lecture will bring these environmental change problems into central focus and we will briefly talk about _what are the problems?_ and _what can we do about them?_

these issues are not separate from each other

The total value of global ecosystem services is estimated to be ~125 trillion US dollars per year; while global gross domestic product (GPD) in 2012 is ~74 trillion $.

Higher temperatures draw moisture out of live and dead trees and brush, making them more flammable. The heat also can alter precipitation, as well as shift spring thaw earlier, lengthening the fire season.

Human impacts on the planet's ecosystems are dramatic and growing. During our life time, these impacts will led to the most significant problems facing the global. One may feel angry about the past, hopeless about the future. But I think our huge impacts on environment also reveals our collective power and the large potential to make our future better. I think now is a fascinating time to be a scientist because never before we have had such significant and complex impacts on the ecosystems, while at the same time we also have powerful tools to solve issues and conserve life. Whether or not you pursue a career in Global Change Biology, I hope this lecture will help us to be more informed citizens. Together, we can make our future better and sustainable.
